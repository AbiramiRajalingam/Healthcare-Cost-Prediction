# Healthcare-Cost-Prediction


Understanding the financial impact of medical expenses, particularly in relation to conditions like obesity, is crucial for devising effective preventive measures. By analyzing a dataset encompassing factors such as age, BMI, smoking, exercise habits, and marital status across seven states in the US, we aim to predict healthcare costs for individuals. This predictive analysis serves as a valuable tool for healthcare management organizations (HMOs), offering actionable insights into how to minimize overall healthcare expenditures. With a focus on preventing obesity from a young age and promoting an active lifestyle, our goal is to provide concrete recommendations for reducing healthcare costs and improving public health outcomes.
